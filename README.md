       Program    Version     Compiler
        Name                  Features
      ```

## Compilation
The pre-compiled binaries ***do not contain features***, it is only for the bare minimum of downloading an e-hentai gallery.

The features listed below must be compiled manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kiwifuit/ehentai-dl
cd ehentai-dl
cargo build --features <config,aniyomi,etc>
```

## Compilation: Features
### `aniyomi`
Writes the necessary metadata and file structure for Aniyomi to parse.

### `zip`
Zips the whole gallery and deletes the original. ***Does not work with Aniyomi's way of parsing zip files***, so this feature is only intended for storage and/or data transfer

### `config`
Compiled features can be turned on and off here. The program will error out when you try to set for a feature that wasn't compiled with the binary.

Also contains feature-specific configuration

**This is a work in progress**
