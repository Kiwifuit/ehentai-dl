## Features
### `aniyomi`
Writes an additional `details.json` meta file, along with a `.nomedia` file for every directory.

This feature is meant to go well with Aniyomi, a manga reader and anime watcher.

### `zip`
Zips the whole gallery and deletes the original. Uses the `bizp2` feature of the `zip` crate.

### `config`
Compiled features can be turned on and off here. The program will error out when you try to set for a feature that wasn't compiled with the binary

**This is a work in progress**
