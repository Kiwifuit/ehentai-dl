## Features
*(For the moment, at least) **YOU CAN ONLY PICK EITHER ONE FEATURE FLAG***. Please read below for details.

### `aniyomi`
Writes an additional `details.json` meta file, along with a `.nomedia` file for every directory.

This feature is meant to go well with Aniyomi, a manga reader and anime watcher. ~~**Does not work with the `zip` feature due to how Aniyomi handles zip files**~~

### `zip`
Zips the whole gallery and deletes the original. Uses the `bizp2` feature of the `zip` crate.

~~***This feature does not work with the `aniyomi` feature***~~

### `config`
Compiled features can be turned on and off here. The program will error out when you try to set for a feature that wasn't compiled with the binary

**This is a work in progress**. In fact, it hasn't even started development
